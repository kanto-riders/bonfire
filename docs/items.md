    * There are bigger products, but if it's just for cutting branches 210mm is plenty.
* Lighter
  * [SOTO Sliding Gas Torch](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B004WMPFWA/)
    * Because you can extend the tip it's easy to light firelighters and such that are buried in deep.
    * You can light cassette gas as-is.
